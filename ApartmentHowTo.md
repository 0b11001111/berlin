# How I got apartment viewings

I used this app: https://www.immobilienscout24.de/ 

I payed for two months of the premium service (29 euro a month).
I setup a “saved search” in the app that would alert me of apartments that fit my requirements.
The most important thing is whenever I would get an alert I would immediately open the app and click apply no matter the apartment since the saved search should have filters.
The app saves short intro message (more on this later). 99% of the time they do not contact you back so applying to view as many as you can is the best method.
You need to apply in the first 1-5 mins. Apparently they get hundreds of requests in the first 10 minutes so you need to at the top of the list. 
My intro with each application was a bullet point list. The shorter and concise the better. 
They see hundreds of these so you want yours to be easy to read. Some people say it should be in German. I only did mine in English.

Example of my intro for the app:
* My & significant other's names (most likely want to specify relationship)
* Net Salary
* Job and job title
* Education
* Pet Info
* Number of kids
* I do not smoke
* I can send the required documents immediately upon request

You must have the documents ready to email! I made a google drive folder with all the document so I could easily
put them in a email and reuse the email. If you use the button in gmail to use a google drive link you can just copy and paste your email and not have to attach the documents for each email. The more documents the better Germans love paperwork.

Documents I would send when requested
1. “About us” pdf document explaining who we are and pictures of my family. Keep it to one long paragraph at most.
2. My 3 previous pay stubs (they were from USA they prefer German ones but that’s all I had)
3. My credit score from the USA (or equivalent in your country)
4. My work contract
5. My insurance policy for liability, my house and my dog
6. A picture of my passport and any other bill payers/adults your applying with (I blurred the passport numbers for this step. Mostly used this as "yes I am a real person")
7. My Schufa score

You will most likely need to have the “Schufa”. If you pay for the immobilienscout app you can request it once a month and they email it to you. 
Much easier than requesting through the official Schufa website! To get a Schufa score you must have a reacurring bill in Germany.
The easiest way I found was to setup a mobile phone contract then request the Schufa after your first bill of the phone contract.
